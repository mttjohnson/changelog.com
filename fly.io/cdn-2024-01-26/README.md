# How do we build a CDN on Fly.io?

## How did this start?

This started as a conversation between @jamesarosen & @gerhard in August 2023:
- https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/discussions/480#discussioncomment-6844844

Several months later, this evolved into a few **epic** pairing sessions &
GitHub threads:
1. https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/discussions/480#discussioncomment-6889082
2. https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/issues/486

The last session was the tipping point that eventually lead to [ðŸŽ§ Kaizen!
Should we build a CDN?](https://changelog.com/friends/26). Here we are today,
trying this crazy idea out and seeing how far we can get in 60 minutes. This
will be a recorded session, link to video will be added as a follow-up.

## What happened in the first recorded session?
